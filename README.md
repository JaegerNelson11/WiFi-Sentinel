# Wi-Fi Sentinel
**Automated Wireless Vulnerability Assessment Tool**

## Project Abstract
Wi-Fi Sentinel is a Python-based security tool designed to scan, analyze, and report on the security posture of nearby wireless networks. It automates the "reconnaissance phase" of penetration testing by identifying 802.11 standards, flagging insecure protocols (WEP/Open), and detecting availability threats like deauthentication flooding.

## Planned Features
* **Network Enumeration:** Identifies 802.11n/ac/ax networks.
* **Protocol Analysis:** Distinguishes between WPA2 and WPA3 security.
* **Threat Detection:** Listens for deauthentication/jamming frames.
* **Reporting:** Generates a "Security Report Card" for local networks.
